# Panoworks_Visual_Field_Color_Experiments
 Code for testing whether colors are the same across the visual field  
 
 Click on 'main.iqx' in each of the folders to run the experiment  
 
 When running the experiment, please enter these values at the start of each run:

* Subject id: _Subject ID_
* Group number: _FIX_ or _MAG_ as appropriate (peripheral magnification)
* Session number: _1.00_ or _0.05_ as appropriate (stimulus size)

It won't break the experiment if you forget to add these values as they should be collected automatically
but it will make our lives easier.
